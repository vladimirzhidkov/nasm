# Exercise 3.21
Write a program that reads lines from the standard input stream, each of which contains the decimal representation of the first number, an arithmetic operation sign (+, -, * , /) and the decimal representation of the second number (without spaces). In response to each line read, the program should print the result of the specified operation on the numbers (consider division as integer division) and add a newline; it should terminate upon an 'end-of-file' condition. If a line does not meet the requirements of the task, the program should print the word 'Error' and a newline, and then continue working.
