# Exercise 3.10
Write a program that reads characters from the standard input stream until the end of the line (i.e., until a character with code 10 is encountered or an 'end-of-file' situation arises) and counts how many '+' and '-' characters are encountered in this line; all other characters are ignored. Let's call the resulting counts N+ and N-. After the end of the line's input, the program calculates the number N* = N+ x N- and prints that number of asterisks.
