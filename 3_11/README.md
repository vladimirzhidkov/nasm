# Exercise 3.11
Write a program that reads characters from the standard input stream until the end of the line (i.e., until a character with code 10 is encountered or an 'end-of-file' situation arises) and calculates the sum of all encountered digits. At the end of the line's input, the program should print a number of asterisks equal to the calculated sum.
